A lean plugin that leverages SharedCount.com API to quickly retrieve, cache, and display various social sharing counts.

## Installation ##

Once installed, go to Settings > Share Count to customize. 

Register at [SharedCount.com](http://www.sharedcount.com), then add your API code to the settings page. In most instances the free plan will be enough due to caching of share counts. 

If you do not provide a SharedCount API key, the plugin will still display share buttons but no counts. I recommend you select "No" in the "Show Empty Counts" dropdown.

Specify the services you would like included, the theme location, and style.
